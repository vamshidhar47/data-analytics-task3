🧰 Tools Used

MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite

SQL Client (MySQL Workbench / pgAdmin / DB Browser / VS Code extensions)

🎯 Task Objective

Use SQL to:

Extract valuable information

Analyze sales, users, revenue

Join multiple tables

Build views

Use subqueries

Apply aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)

🛠️ SQL Concepts Used

This project includes examples of:

✔ SELECT Statements

Filtering, sorting, and selecting relevant fields.

✔ WHERE vs HAVING

WHERE → Filters before aggregation

HAVING → Filters after aggregation

✔ Different Types of JOINS

INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN

RIGHT JOIN

FULL JOIN (if supported)

✔ Subqueries

Used for filtering, comparisons, and nested data extraction.

✔ Aggregate Functions

SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX

✔ Views

Reusable virtual tables created for simple reporting.

✔ Query Optimization

Proper indexing

Avoiding unnecessary subqueries

Using LIMIT

Filtering early using WHERE

📊 Example Insights Extracted

Top-selling products
